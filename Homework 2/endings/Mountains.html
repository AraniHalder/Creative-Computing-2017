You head towards the mountains. After walking for a while (you have lost track of time now) you notice some people standing in a group. You run towards them hoping to ask for help. As you get closer you notice that they have spears in their hands. That does not look inviting. But it's too late, they've already seen you. You're weak and tired (because you didn't eat the berries) and know that there is no point of running. Looks like you're dinner tonight then.<br><br>
