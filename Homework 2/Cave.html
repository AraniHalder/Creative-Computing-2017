You walk into the dark and dingy cave, trying not to slip on the damp floor. You see paintings of animals and people on the walls, as if they were made just a while ago. After walking for about 5 minutes, you hear the roar of water. You carefully make your way into a large opening in the cave and see a huge waterfall. As you're about to walk towards it, you see a small opening to your right.<br><br>
