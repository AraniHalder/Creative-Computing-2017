You walk into the dense trees. The cave gave you the hibbie jibbies anyway. After walking for about 10 minutes you realise that everything looks the same and there seems to be no way out of this forest now. You hear your stomach growl. You look around and spot a small bush of berries to your left. They do look delicious!<br><br>
